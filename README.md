WORK IN PROGRESS

## Monitor 4chan boards for threads with specific keywords and download images

Great tool for getting wallpapers or extra files of specific topics without having to actually go into the page and look for appropriate threads

Adjust boardsettings.py defaultsettings to have a key of all the boards you want monitor and the values for each of them should be an array of keywords

TODO:

- fix thread management
- move rate limiter logic to its own class
- add an oiption to also download comments and not just images
- better error handling
- move file extensions to settings file
- add real instructions about how to run this
- pip file
